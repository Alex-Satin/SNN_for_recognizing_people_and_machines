# SNN_for_recognizing_people_and_machines
I did this work for my bachelor's thesis. I implemented an app that allowed users to upload photos, videos, and connect to a stream so my CNNs could recognize people and different types of vehicles in real time using a drone. I position this work as a tool for emergency responders in critical situations.
